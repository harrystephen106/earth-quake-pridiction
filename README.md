earthquake prediction
### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `earthquake-Predictor/` (that contains this README) and run the following commands:

```bash
python -m notebook AI_Phase1.ipynb
```  
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
